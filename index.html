                <p>What if I told you I was born a different name? Could you image an athlete that enjoys working with technology? Geminis do tend to have spilt personality so that would makes sense that I would have two different names. With my father being a junior, you can assume that he would want for me to be named after him. But my mother was somewhat old school and if my father wanted me to be named after him then that would happen when they were married, so Madison Chase Hodge was born. It wasn't until I was almost three that I became William Madison Sams III. As someone who grew up as an athlete that was what I was known as. I have always been the basketball guy. Transitioning to Arizona and reinventing myself in the tech field has been a life changing experience that is tapping into a part of myself that I have wanted to express but never knew how. Madison Chase displays himself when I work with anything technology based. Welcome to the portfolio for Chase that will display my ability to be a full stack developer.</p>
